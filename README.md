Domain decomposition methods for machine learning.

The code uses minGPT and builds from it: https://github.com/karpathy/minGPT/tree/master

## Requirements
See ``pyproject.toml`` file. 

## Installation
This project is still in development. To install it in editable mode, you can run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cruzas/DD4ML.git
cd DD4ML
python3 -m pip install -e .
```

If you are satisfied with the current version and plan no further changes, you can run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cruzas/DD4ML.git
cd DD4ML
python3 -m pip install .
```

## CUDA Support
For ***GPU support***, install the appropriate CUDA-enabled version of PyTorch before installing this package. For example, to install PyTorch with CUDA 12.4:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124
```

## Usage
In a ***local*** environment (e.g. PC), for example, you can run:
```bash
open -a Docker
wandb server start
python3 ./experiments/run_config_file.py --sweep_config="./experiments/config_files/<config_file>.yaml"
```
See `experiments/config_files/` for the available configurations.

In a ***cluster*** environment, e.g. managed by SLURM, you can run:
```bash
cd experiments
./submit_jobs.sh --config <config_name>
```
`<config_name>` must match a file in `experiments/job_configs/` (without the `.conf` extension); it defines the optimizers, datasets, models and sweep parameters for the job. `submit_jobs.sh` and `submit_jobs_common.sh` take care of the job name, wandb usage, and picking the right cluster job template (`rosa.job` or `daintalps.job`, selected automatically based on the environment) — there's nothing to edit by hand. Change the time/number of GPUs/etc. directly in the relevant `.conf` file or job template if needed.

Cluster runs also need three files in your home directory on the cluster:
`~/.tests_runpath` (defining `TESTS_RUNPATH`, the absolute path to this repo's
`experiments/` directory), `~/.slurm_env` (defining `SLURM_ACCOUNT`, daint-alps
only) and `~/.wandb_env` (wandb credentials, sourced only when wandb is
enabled). `TESTS_RUNPATH` is a legacy name from when these scripts lived under
`tests/` — it must point at `experiments/`. See
[experiments/README.md](experiments/README.md) for the details and for how to
switch to `EXPERIMENTS_RUNPATH` instead.

Note: 
- The code works with or without wandb. If you need it, make sure to install wandb accordingly.
- The ```Factory``` class defined in ```src/dd4ml/utility/factory.py``` allows you to dynamically add new classes, datasets, etc.
- Ensure that the configured ```batch_size``` is at least the number of processes (```world_size```). If it is smaller, each process defaults to a per-process batch size of 1.

## Structure
This library is meant to be general. 

The repository is laid out as follows:
- `src/dd4ml` — the installable library
- `tests` — the pytest suite, and nothing else
- `experiments` — run configurations, SLURM job templates, sweep submission scripts and analysis helpers
- `plotting` — figure and table generation

The src folder is structured as follows:
- datasets (for processing data in rawdata)
- models 
- optimizers
- pmw
- utility

You can extend the library by adding your own files in any of these modules. If you create a new folder within them, make sure to add an ```__init__.py``` file and then re-run ```python3 -m pip install .```, or ```python3 -m pip install --force-reinstall .``` if necessary.

## Note
In case it's necessary, you may need to run the following:
```bash
python3 -m pip install --force-reinstall .
```
Based on your Python environment, you may need to also clear out the site-packages directory. You can find it by using the following command:
```bash
python3 -m site
```

Before using using wandb locally on your computer, you need to make an account. Then, you can run the following command:
```bash
wandb login --relogin --host=http://127.0.0.1
```
You will need your API key: https://wandb.ai/authorize
Once you have done this, your credentials are saved. For more information, please consult: https://docs.wandb.ai/quickstart/

## Funding
This work was initially supported by the Swiss Platform for Advanced Scientific Computing (PASC) project **ExaTrain** (funding periods 2017-2021 and 2021-2024) and by the Swiss National Science Foundation through the projects "ML<sup>2</sup> -- Multilevel and Domain Decomposition Methods for Machine Learning" (197041) and "Multilevel training of DeepONets -- multiscale and multiphysics applications" (206745).
